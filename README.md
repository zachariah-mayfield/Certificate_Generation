# Certificate Generation with Ansible

This project contains an Ansible role to generate a **Root Certificate Authority (CA)**,  
a **Vault server certificate**, and a **Vault client certificate** â€” all signed by the same CA.

It replicates the functionality of an OpenSSL bash script, but is implemented entirely in Ansible.

## Generated Files

By default, all generated certificates and keys are placed in:

# 
You can change this path by overriding the `Out_Directory` variable.

The following files will be created:

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `rootCA.key`  | Root CA private key |
| `rootCA.crt`  | Root CA certificate (self-signed) |
| `vault-server.key` | Server private key |
| `vault-server.csr` | Server Certificate Signing Request |
| `vault-server.crt` | Server certificate signed by Root CA |
| `vault-client.key` | Client private key |
| `vault-client.csr` | Client Certificate Signing Request |
| `vault-client.crt` | Client certificate signed by Root CA |
| `vault-client.pfx` | Client certificate and key in PKCS#12 format |
